"""The decision tree begins with [feature], indicating itâ€™s the strongest predictor of crop suitability. As we move down the tree, [feature] and [feature] refine the classification further. For example, when [condition], the model predicts [crop], aligning with agricultural best practices in similar environments.

"""This project applies machine learning to improve crop selection decisions in Kenya, supporting SDG 2 (Zero Hunger). Using rainfall, temperature, soil pH, and nutrient levels, the system predicts optimal crops, helping farmers increase yield and sustainability.

- Model Training with Decision Tree
- Visualization of Decision Paths
- Performance Evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall)
- Insight Extraction & Model Export

The model revealed rainfall and potassium levels as the strongest predictors. For regions with high rainfall and balanced pH, crops like rice were recommended, while lower moisture favored maize or millet. This aligns with agricultural practices in semi-arid zones.
